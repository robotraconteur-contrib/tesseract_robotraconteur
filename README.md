# Tesseract Robot Raconteur Service

The `tesseract_robotraconteur_service` provides a Tesseract planner in the form of a 
[Robot Raconteur](https://github.com/robotraconteur/robotraconteur) service. The service is a wrapper around the 
[Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-planning/tesseract) motion planning library. The service
provides a simple interface to the Tesseract motion planning library.

Robot Raconteur is a powerful open-source object-oriented communication framework for robotics, automation, and
other distributed systems. Robot Raconteur provides unique features such as an augmented-object
oriented data model, enhanced value types, true plug-and-play operation, and
advanced discovery/subscriptions. Robot Raconteur supports a large number of programming languages
including C++, Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, MATLAB and LabView. Supported platforms
include Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, FreeBSD, and embedded systems.

The design of Robot Raconteur allows for the interface to closely match the underlying C++ interface.
This allows for the client to have a similar experience as if they were using the C++ interface. Because
of the large number of supported languages and platforms, this allows for a large number of clients to
be developed. See the service definitions specific to Tesseract in the `robdef` directory. Also
see the [Standard Robot Raconteur Service Definitions](https://github.com/robotraconteur/robotraconteur_standard_robdef)
which are available for use in any Robot Raconteur service.

Currently the service is capable of loading environments and executing planning operations.
Over time as much of the API as possible will be exposed.

## Running the Service

The service can be run as a local executable or using Docker. It is recommended that Docker be used if possible.

### Running the service using Docker

The service is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wasontech/tesseract_robotraconteur).

Run the service using the following command:

```bash
sudo docker run --rm --net=host \
  -v /var/run/robotraconteur:/var/run/robotraconteur \
  -v /var/lib/robotraconteur:/var/lib/robotraconteur \
  -v /ws/install/share:/res \
  -e TESSERACT_RESOURCE_PATH=/res \
  -e URDF_FILE=/res/tesseract_support/urdf/abb_irb2400.urdf \
  -e SRDF_FILE=/res/tesseract_support/urdf/abb_irb2400.srdf \
  docker.io/wasontech/tesseract_robotraconteur
```

This relatively complex command is required to allow the service to run in the Docker container and
still be able to find the Robot Raconteur transport and discovery services. With
`--net=host` the service will use the host network stack. This is required for auto-discovery to work.


The following environment variables are available:

* `TESSERACT_RESOURCE_PATH`: This is the path for the resource loader to search for packages. 
  Paths are separated with `:` (Unix) or `;` (Windows). The resource files will need to be
  mounted into the container. In this example, the resource directory `/ws/install/share` is
 mounted to `/res` in the container, and the environment variable is set to `/res`.
* `URDF_FILE`: The path to the URDF file to load. This is relative to the filesystem in the container.
* `SRDF_FILE`: The path to the SRDF file to load. This is relative to the filesystem in the container.
* `TASK_PLUGIN_CONFIG_FILE`: The path to the task plugin config file to load. For
  most cases this is not required and the default will be used. This is relative to the filesystem in the container.

### Building and Running the Service locally

Building Tesseract can be difficult. See
the [tesseract_planning](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning) repository for more 
information on building Tesseract. Use the `dependencies.repos` file in this repository to get the 
additional dependencies required to build the service.

Once built, use the following command to run the service:

```bash
export TESSERACT_RESOURCE_PATH=/ws/install/share
./tesseract_robotraconteur_service -urdf-file=/ws/install/share/tesseract_support/urdf/abb_irb2400.urdf \
     --srdf-file=/ws/install/share/tesseract_support/urdf/abb_irb2400.srdf \
     --task-plugin-config-file=/ws/devel/share/tesseract_task_composer/config/task_composer_plugins.yaml
```

The following options are available:

* `--urdf-file`: The path to the URDF file to load
* `--srdf-file`: The path to the SRDF file to load
* `--task-plugin-config-file`: The path to the task plugin config file to load
* `export TESSERACT_RESOURCE_PATH`: This is the path for the resource loader to search for packages. 
  Paths are separated with `:` (Unix) or `;` (Windows). This is required for the service to find things
  like meshes and configuration files.

The standard Robot Raconteur options are also available. See 
[Robot Raconteur Node Command Line Options](https://github.com/robotraconteur/robotraconteur/wiki/Command-Line-Options) 
for more information.

## Using the Service

The service is a wrapper around the Tesseract motion planning library. The following example
shows how to use the service in Python. The same example is available in C++. See the
`examples` directory for more examples.

```python

#
# The client example only requires the robotraconteur and companion library.
# The Tesseract libraries are not required for the client.

# Import Robot Raconteur and general Python modules. The companion package is not
# required but contains some utility classes for working with Robot Raconteur that
# simplify working with advanced types.
